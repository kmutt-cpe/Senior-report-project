In a multihop ad hoc network, the interference among nodes is
  reduced to maximize the throughput by using a smallest transmission
  range that still preserve the network connectivity. However, most
  existing works on transmission range control focus on the
  connectivity but lack of results on the throughput performance. This
  paper analyzes the per-node saturated throughput of an IEEE 802.11b
  multihop ad hoc network with a uniform transmission range. Compared
  to simulation, our model can accurately predict the per-node
  throughput.  The results show that the maximum achievable per-node
  throughput can be as low as 11\% of the channel capacity in a normal
  set of $\alpha$ operating parameters independent of node density. However, if
  the network connectivity is considered, the obtainable throughput
  will reduce by as many as 43\% of the maximum throughput.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background} 

Explain the background of your works for readers. You can refer to figure by like this.. Figure~\ref{fig:x1}.
\begin{figure}[!h]
\caption{This is the figure x11}\label{fig:x1}
\end{figure}

Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?

"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion. Thank you, steal again. I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn.

…And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!

You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Jesus must be spinning in his grave!

I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry?

I was saying "Boo-urns." Bart, with \$10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.

How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.

Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.


\section{Motivations}

\section{Model Prediction Subsystem Result}
\subsection{Training Siamese Neural Network with MaLSTM Result}
After preprocessing the data, we split the data into train, validate, and test data. Then separate the data into left inputs and right inputs, one for each side of MaLSTM. Then train the model with 100 epochs and use batch sizes 128. In addition to using early stops to prevent the model too overfitting and model checkpoint to save the model. Even our group set 100 epochs, but the model was trained only 17 epochs before stopping from early stop. Loss of training data is 0.4116 and loss of validation data is 0.4358. Also, accuracy of training data is 0.5487 and accuracy of validation data is 0.4358. Graphs below are the result from training.

\begin{figure}[!h]\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[width= 15cm]{./ch4_3.png}}
\caption{Model accuracy}\label{fig:Model accuracy}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[!h]\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[width= 15cm]{./ch4_4.png}}
\caption{Model loss}\label{fig:Model loss}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Evaluation Model Result}
The result from the model is the real number from 0 to 1. We interpret both questions are similar (result = 1) if the model predicted score is more than 0.3. If the model predicted score is less than 0.3, both questions are not similar (result = 0). We pick 0.3 to be a criterion for similar or not similar because we have picked 0.6 and 0.5 already but accuracy is very low. After the model predicts the test data, we convert from a similar score (0 to 1)  to binary (0 or 1) instead before evaluating. As you can see in the training topic, we use accuracy and loss to be the main criteria to evaluate the model while training. But in this process we will also use accuracy, precision, and F1-score to evaluate the model. The picture below is the result after evaluating the model with test data.

\begin{figure}[!h]\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[width= 15cm]{./ch4_5.png}}
\caption{Classification report}\label{fig:Classification report}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[!h]\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[width= 15cm]{./ch4_6.png}}
\caption{Confusion matrix}\label{fig:Confusion matrix}
\end{figure}

The accuracy after evaluating with test data is 0.527. From the confusion matrix and classification report, the overall model performs accuracy with 52.7\%. There are two classes and we got class o with less precision around 25\%. but we have got class 1 with high precision with 76\%.
\subsection{Siamese Neural Network with MaLSTM Model Result}

The picture below shows an example result from playing with the model. The Input questions are
{
\XeTeXlinebreaklocale "th_TH"	
\thaifont 
'วิศวะคอมเรียนหลักสูตรอะไรบ้างคะ' }
and
{
\XeTeXlinebreaklocale "th_TH"	
\thaifont 
 ' วิศวะคอมมีหลักสูตรอะไรบ้าง'. 
}Both questions are similar and our model can predict both questions are similar for 83.33\%.

\begin{figure}[!h]\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[width= 15cm]{./ch4_7.png}}
\caption{Model result by compare questions which similar}\label{fig:Model result by compare questions which similar}
\end{figure}

From others example from playing with model.The Input questions are
{
\XeTeXlinebreaklocale "th_TH"	
\thaifont 
 ‘ วิศวะคอมเรียนเกี่ยวกับอะไรบ้าง’ }and 
{
\XeTeXlinebreaklocale "th_TH"	
\thaifont ‘ วิศวะคอมมีเรียนหลักสูตรอะไรบ้าง’.}
 Both questions are not similar and our model can predict both questions are not similar for 57.14\%

\begin{figure}[!h]\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[width= 15cm]{./ch4_8.png}}
\caption{Model result by compare questions which not similar}\label{fig:Model result by compare questions which not similar}
\end{figure}

Even the model can predict, but the overall performance of the model is quite not good. Because we think the model should return similar questions from MaLSTM more than 0.5 scores not 0.3 scores. We think that the problem comes from not enough data. If we can gather more dataset and have more cases about question pairs that are similar or not similar, especially not similar that we got less precision, we can increase our model's performance. Also we have to integrate all subsystem to be one system in the production environment.

This appendix describes two static allocation methods for fGn (or fBm)
traffic. Here, $\lambda$ and $C$ are respectively the traffic arrival
rate and the service rate per dimensionless time step. Their unit are
converted to a physical time unit by multiplying the step size
$\Delta$. For a fBm self-similar traffic source,
Norros~\cite{norros95} provides its EB as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norros}
  C = \lambda + (\kappa(H)\sqrt{-2\ln\epsilon})^{1/H}a^{1/(2H)}x^{-(1-H)/H}\lambda^{1/(2H)}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa(H) = H^H(1-H)^{(1-H)}$. Simplicity in the calculation is
the attractive feature of (\ref{eq:norros}).

The MVA technique developed in~\cite{kim01} so far provides the most
accurate estimation of the loss probability compared to previous
bandwidth allocation techniques according to simulation results.
Consider a discrete-time queueing system with constant service rate
$C$ and input process $\lambda_n$ with $\mathbb{E}\{\lambda_n\} =
\lambda$ and $\mathrm{Var}\{\lambda_n\} = \sigma^2$.  Define $X_n \equiv
\sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k - Cn$.  The loss probability due to the MVA
approach is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:loss_mva}
  \varepsilon \approx \alpha e^{-m_x/2}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mx}
m_x = \min_{n \geq 0} \frac{((C-\lambda)n + B)^2}{\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}} =
\frac{((C-\lambda)n^\ast + B)^2}{\mathrm{Var}\{X_{n^{\ast}}\}}
\end{equation} 
and 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha}
  \alpha =
  \frac{1}{\lambda\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left(\frac{(C-\lambda)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
  \int_C^\infty (r-C)\exp\left(\frac{(r-\lambda)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\, dr
\end{equation}
For a given $\varepsilon$, we numerically solve for $C$ that satisfies
(\ref{eq:loss_mva}). Any search algorithm can be used to do the task.
Here, the bisection method is used.  

Next, we show how $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ can be determined.  Let
$C_{\lambda}(l)$ be the autocovariance function of $\lambda_n$.  The
MVA technique basically approximates the input process $\lambda_n$
with a Gaussian process, which allows $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ to be
represented by the autocovariance function.  In particular, the
variance of $X_n$ can be expressed in terms of $C_{\lambda}(l)$ as
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Var}\{X_n\} = nC_{\lambda}(0) + 2\sum_{l=1}^{n-1} (n-l)C_{\lambda}(l)
\end{equation} 
Therefore, $C_{\lambda}(l)$ must be known in the MVA technique, either
by assuming specific traffic models or by off-line analysis in case of
traces.  In most practical situations, $C_{\lambda}(l)$ will not be
known in advance, and an on-line measurement algorithm developed
in~\cite{eun01} is required to jointly determine both $n^\ast$ and
$m_x$. For fGn traffic, $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ is equal to $\sigma^2
n^{2H}$, where $\sigma^2 = \mathrm{Var}\{\lambda_n\}$, and we can find
the $n^\ast$ that minimizes (\ref{eq:mx}) directly. Although $\lambda$
can be easily measured, it is not the case for $\sigma^2$ and $H$.
Consequently, the MVA technique suffers from the need of prior
knowledge traffic parameters.
